| An appender for log4net that helps you log to an Azure Storage Table. This appender
| can be used as a generic solution for Azure Websites, Azure Webroles and Azure
| Workerroles or even any desktop application for which you want the logs to end
| up in a storage account.
|
| The format in which the messages are saved is compatible with the existing Windows
| Azure Diagnostics (wad) format. Hence any applications that makes use of this will
| function with this appender as well.
|
| For now the appender must be configured via code. Configuration via an 
| app/web/log4net.config file is not (yet) supported.
|
| Example configuration:
|    var credentials = new StorageCredentialsAccountAndKey(storageName, storageKey)
|    var appender = new TableStorageAppender(credentials)
|    {
|        Layout = layout,
|        Threshold = Level.Debug,
|        Name = "TableStorageAppender",
|        TransferIntervalInMinutes = 1,
|        LogmarkerIntervalInMinutes = 15
|    };
|    appender.ActivateOptions();
|
|    // Configure hierarchy
|    Hierarchy hierarchy = LogManager.GetRepository() as Hierarchy;
|    hierarchy.Root.AddAppender(appender);
|
| Or, using the helper which allows for some degree of configuration:
|    // Initializes logging from configuration. The NameValueCollection will read the
|    // following properties:
|    //  - LogType: TableStorage or File
|    //  - LogStorageName: account name for the storage account
|    //  - LogStorageKey: key for the storage account
|    //  - LogStorageTable: optional, customize the table to log to
|    //  - LogFile: Filename to log to
|    LoggingHelper.InitializeFromConfiguration(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings);
